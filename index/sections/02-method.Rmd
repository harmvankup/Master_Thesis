# Methodology

## Study site

Sediment cores and surface water were gathered at Bovenlanden, a peat meadow in South-Holland, the Netherlands (N 52&deg;, 9' E 4&deg;,52'). (Fig. \@ref(fig:BL)) The area functioned as farmland in the past, and is heavily influenced by fertilization. Nowdays, Bovenlanden is managed by Natuurmonumenten, in a conservation effort to restore biodiversity in the western peat meadow system of the Netherlands. The goal is to restore types of grassland common before industrialization of farming, which have typically more diverse vegetation and form a habitat for breeding meadow birds. To establish a nutrient poor wet meadow, water quality had to be improved. To reduce external influx of P, most ditches in the southern part have been detached from the surrounding surface water, keeping only one inlet via a weir, and runoff from land was reduced by removing the top layer of soil containing most of the nutrients. In 2020, 60 tons of iron sludge was added to the southern two ditches to mitigate internal P loading. Water quality improved on visual inspection after a few months after the treatment.

## Core sampling

Sediment cores were collected on site the 23rd of February 2021. Two locations on the same treated ditch were chosen based on distance from the inlet weir, each treated location was paired with a reference location in a non-treated ditch nearby. (Fig. \@ref(fig:sampleloc)) For each of the four locations 7 cores were collected  using a UWITEC corer with a diameter of 6 cm. Sediment depth in the cores was approximately 40 cm, with 20cm overlying water. Extra surface water was collected for refilling during incubation sampling. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity were measured using probes. Surface water samples were collected and filtered on site using 0.45$\mu$m pore size nylon syringe filters. 10 mL was subsampled for Fe and P measurement, and directly acidified with 1% 3.75M HNO$_3$, and another 2mL subsampled and treated by adding 0.2% zinc acetate to fix sulfide. All surface water samples and subsamples were stored cool.

Directly after the field campaign, one core from each location was sliced for porewater and sediment analysis. Slicing was performed under low oxygen conditions in a glovebag filled with nitrogen gas. Slices were removed with a plastic spoon at intervals of 1cm for the top 10cm, and 2cm intervals at greater depth. Sediment slices were collected in 50mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 3000rpm for 10min to separate porewater from the solid sediment. In a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere, the porewater was decanted into a syringe with a 0.45$\mu$m nylon filter and filtered into four subsamples: 5mL acidified with 1% 3.75M HNO$_3$ for Fe and P measurements, 2mL with 0.2% zinc acetate for sulfide measurement, 1mL in a vial for ion chromatography, and the remainder for measuring ammonium. The solid sediment was freezedried, and homogenized with an agate mortal and pestle under nitrogen atmosphere. Wet samples were stored cool (5&deg;C) in airtight containers, dry sediment was kept under nitrogen atmosphere.

## Sequential extractions of Fe pools
Analysis of the iron pools in the solid phase was done with a sequential extraction method based on @claffSequentialExtractionProcedure2010. The method was modified to include phosphate measurements of the extracted pools by omitting the pyrophosphate extraction in the main sequential extraction. Relatively low concentrations of phosphate in the extract is not distinguishable from pyrophosphate using elemental analysis, and a test confirmed that photometric phosphate analysis did not work in a pyrophosphate matrix. Furthermore, the chemical similarity between pyrophosphate and phosphate could influence the phosphate binding to iron in other phases other than the targeted organic bound iron. For this reason, a two-step extraction of MgCl and pyrophosphate was performed parallel to the main extraction to target iron complexed with organic matter. (Table \@ref(tab:seqextr))

Approximately 100mg of dry sediment was weighed into a 15mL centrifuge tube. For each extraction step, 10 mL of extraction solution was added with a dispenser under a continuous nitrogen flow. After addition, the mixture was weighed, resuspended and shaken for a specified time. After extraction, the suspension was centrifuged for 10min at 3000rpm, and the supernatant decanted into a syringe with 0.45$\mu$m filter and the next extraction solution was added immediately. The extractant was filtered and diluted 10 times before analysis (see below). The last extraction step, which uses concentrated nitric acid and therefore very reactive to material left in the filter, was not filtered and diluted 100 times to bring to a workable pH.

## Incubation setup for benthic flux measurements

To monitor benthic fluxes under oxic and anoxic conditions, sediment cores where incubated in a climate chamber at 10&deg;C for 60 days. For each location two cores were allowed to turn anoxic, and two where kept oxic by aerating the overlying water by a submerged air stream. To induce anoxic conditions, the cores were closed with an airtight cap with a stirrer and filled completely with surface water. (Fig. \@ref(fig:setup))  The decay in dissolved oxygen in the overlying water was monitored with an oxygen probe. Change in composition of the overlying water was monitored by taking 20 mL water from 1-3 cm above the sediment-water interface using a syringe and tube, and filtered through a 0.45$\mu$m nylon syringe filter and directly subsampled following the procedure as described for the porewater. The water was replenished using surface water collected at the locations, in the anoxic cores this was done simultaneously when taking samples to prevent air entering the core. Samples where taken from the overlying water on daily basis the first two weeks, and 2-3 times a week for the remaining experiment. At the end of the experiment, one anoxic core for each location was sliced and processed for porewater and sediment analysis.

## Analytical procedures

Surface water, incubation samples and porewater were analyzed on phosphate, total iron, ferrous iron (Fe$^{2+}$), sulfide and ammonium with spectrophotometry following standardized methods using coloring reagents.[@murphyModifiedSingleSolution1962] For P and Fe measurements, as precaution against oxidation, subsamples were acidified after sampling with 1% 3.75M HNO$_3$. [@brayPhosphateInterstitialWaters1973] Calibration lines for ammonium, total iron and Fe$^{2+}$ were freshly made every day of measurement, while the phosphate calibration line was made once and remeasured. Water samples were also measured by ion chromatography (IC), to quantify common anions including sulfate and nitrate. The diluted extraction solutions gathered during the sequential extraction procedure were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). In addition, spectrophotometry was deployed to identify the oxidation state of dissolved iron, which was only possible in the HCl extracted pool, as CBD and concentrated HNO$_3$ strongly influence the redox potential, and the MgCl and pyrophosphate extracts were exposed to oxygen during the extraction procedure. However, the sediment was kept under nitrogen flow, and the low pH of HCl stabilizes the redox state. Since HCl extracts various different reactive iron species, an evaluation on the redox state is useful. However, many values of Fe$^{2+}$ were found higher than total iron concentration. Total iron measured with spectrophotometry correlated strongly with ICP-OES Fe data, and is thus considered to be more reliable than the Fe$^{2+}$ results, which are excluded from this study. 

The saturation index (SI), which signifies if a mineral is under- or supersaturated with respect to a certain mineral, and is derived from the equilibrium constant and the activities of the dissolved species of the formation reaction, was calculated for vivianite using the program Mineql 5.0 [@MINEQLChemicalEquilibrum] with the corresponding data base. As the pH of the pore water has not been measured, the pH was systematically varied between 6.0 and 8.0. For the calculation the average total concentrations of dissolved Fe and P in the pore water of the top 10 cm was used with values of 4 and 200 $\mu$M, respectively. The ionic strength was assumed to be 1.0 mM. All other data was processed with R in Rstudio. Concentrations were all converted into $\mu$mol per g for solids, and $\mu$mol per L for solutions. The incubation data was also converted to mole per unit area by multiplying the measured concentrations by the water volume and dividing by the sediment surface area in the core. From linear regression slopes of these values over time the benthic fluxes were calculated, which were tested on significance with a simple T test with a significance level of 0.05.
