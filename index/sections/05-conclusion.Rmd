# Conclusions



This study shows concretely how Fe treatment influences dynamics in the sediment when we compared treated and untreated ditches within the same system. Legacy P in untreated sediment, predominantly released from OM mineralization, freely diffuses to the surface water where it accumulates at high rates, underscoring the extent of internal loading in the ditch system. Locations treated with Fe-containing by-products will produce starkly reduced internal P loading, and even a highly eutrophic system can be brought to acceptable P levels in this way. 

The Fe from treatment stayed within the top 10 cm, and deeper in the sediment the treated cores resemble the original sediment. Fe extracted by HCl and CBD correlate with the total iron, and contains presumably iron oxides remaining from the treatment, as the residence time since treatment (6 months) is insufficient to completely reduce all stable oxide phases. P previously dissolved in the porewater is subsequently bound to the added iron and this brings down the internal P load significantly. 

While we can conclude that the treatment was successful within a year, we have to be careful when extrapolating the results to the future. The amount of P released to the surface water, which ultimately defines the internal load, is a result of complex interactions between Fe, P, S and OM in the sediment, and is difficult to predict.  Based on other research on FeCl$_2$ treatment of peat lakes we expect that the treatment in this system rapidly loses effect as soon as sulfide starts to accumulate and the high OM content instead acts as a iron sink as well as a phosphate source. [@immersFightingInternalPhosphorus2015] It is also imperative to remove any external P load, which will accumulate in the Fe oxide pool and lower the effectiveness of the treatment. 

To conclude,  the treatment proves to be an effective method for the restoration of peaty freshwater ecosystems on the short to middle term, and is much more cost-efficient and low-maintanance compared to other treatments.
