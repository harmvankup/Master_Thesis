## Fe speciation and cycling in the sediment

The peat meadow system in this study is generally very poor in iron, and the Fe content in the original sediment attributes to less than 2\% of the dry weight. The majority of the iron in the untreated cores was extracted in the HNO$_3$ pool, most likely as result of crystalline sulfide phases such as pyrite formed in the sediment, where high sulfide concentrations are found in the porewater. Phosphate is scarcely found within sulfide phases, so the presence of phosphate in this pool would be better explained as consequence of oxidation of the organic matrix during the extraction, where concentrated HNO$_3$ can act as oxidator mineralizing OM and P is mobilized. Iron and phosphate bound electrostatically to organic matter would have been extracted in earlier extraction steps, and do not influence these results. [@donisaCombinationDifferentExtractants2007]

Addition of iron drastically changed the composition of the sediment and porewater. The top 10cm of treated cores show iron contents up to 20 wt\%, and in contrast to the iron in the untreated sediment which is immobilized in stable sulfide phases, the added iron is mostly found in the reactive HCl pool. Deeper in the sediment the treated cores resemble the original sediment, as the iron from treatment stayed within the top 10 cm. Concurrent with the HCl pool, significant iron extracted from the treated sediment was found in the pyrophosphate and CBD pools. Iron content in the CBD pool correlates with the total iron, and are presumed to be crystalline iron oxides remaining from the treatment sludge, as the residence time since treatment (6 months) is insufficient to completely reduce more stable oxide phases such as goethite.  Pyrophosphate extracts iron associated with organic matter (Fe-OM) by solubilising organic substances. [@claffSequentialExtractionProcedure2010] However, Fe is not extracted quantitatively from the organic matter pool, and Fe bound to less reactive OM may not be extracted. [@donisaCombinationDifferentExtractants2007; @niskanenExtractableAluminiumIron1989] Still, it shows that Fe-OM is present uniformly where Fe content is high, and does not correlate with total iron in sediment or porewater. In fact, the abundance of Fe in the pyrophoshate pool decreases with depth below 6 cm, above de depth at which the total iron in sediment peaks. This implies that the formation of pyrophosphate extractable Fe-OM in deeper sediment is limited by the availability of reactive organic substances rather than the iron concentration, which contradicts with the fact that organic matter is abundant even in deeper layers. It is possible that iron is still complexed at depths where iron content is high, but with less reactive forms of organic matter and thus less extractable with pyrophosphate. 

 Iron is found dissolved in the porewater in strong correlation with solid phase iron content, and in particularly the HCl pool. (Fig. \@ref(fig:seq)) The high concentrations of both Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ in the porewater suggest tthat reductive dissolution is not the only way iron is mobilized. Direct dissolution of oxides could play a role when the pH becomes sufficiently low. This is unlikely but could be the case very locally where Fe$^{3+}$ oxidizes organic matter and protons are released. However, the buffer capacity of the porewater is unknown and no pH data is available. Another explanation is that the measured Fe$^{3+}$ is not truly dissolved, but rather suspended in the porewater as colloidal iron oxide smaller than the filter poresize (.45$\mu$m). Alternatively, the iron could be complexed with dissolved organic matter and become mobilized. The high abundancy of OM in sediment matrix favors this theory, and it would explain the relative redox insensitivity of iron dissolution in the sediment, as both oxidation states of iron can remain in complex with organic matter. Other studies have found that organic bound Fe$^{3+}$ does reduce less easily, which explains the possibility of high concentration of Fe$^{3+}$ under low redox conditions. [@oconnellChangesSedimentaryPhosphorus2020; @schwertmannNatureIronOxide1988] The redox insensitivity of Fe-OM is also seen in the solid phase, despite the lack of data on the oxidation state of iron. The pyrophosphate pool did not decrease after incubating under anoxic conditions for two months,  and even increased relative to the stable CBD pool. This increase can be explained by the complexation of Fe$^{2+}$ formed by reductive dissolution of redox sensitive phases in the HCl or CBD pools. 

The low abundance of iron in the original sediment means that below the aerobic zone (<0.5cm), sulfate has become the principle electron acceptor below the aerobic zone. This can be seen in the porewater profiles as the sulfate concentration decreases with depth, and reduced sulfur in the form of sulfide accumulates. Whilst the formed sulfide is found in first instance dissolved in the porewater, it will immediately precipitate when dissolved Fe$^{2+}$ is present. [@smoldersSulphatemediatedIronLimitation1993] This increased the HNO$_3$ pool in the non-treated cores during anoxic incubation, when the reservoir of iron oxide in the oxic top layer was reduced and pyrite was formed. Sulfide in the untreated sediment is in large excess to iron, thus found in dissolved form throughout the core. The iron treatment has increased the availabilty of Fe$^{2+}$ largely, yet no evidence for large scale pyrite formation can be found, since the HNO$_3$ pool in the treated cores is not larger, but smaller compared to the reference cores. Still,  sulfide concentrations in the porewater are low in the iron-rich layer, suggesting the sulfide did react and is now found in another pool, possibly in the HCl pool as iron monosulfide (FeS).   


## Coupling Fe and P in the sediment

Phosphate in the non-treated cores is found in high levels dissolved in the porewater. This is in stark contrast with the treated cores, where phosphate concentration is very low in at depths where iron is abundant. This decrease in concentration is best explained as a consequence of phosphate binding to Fe species in the solid phase. Because the treatment aims to decrease phosphate concentrations in the overlying water at longer timescales, it is important to assess where and how the phosphate is bound in the sediment, and how it is coupled with Fe cycling. Analysis of phosphate within the extracted pools shows that most of the phosphate is extracted in the HCl step. The HCl extracted phosphate pool dominates in both treated and untreated sediments, despite the fact that the HCl pool in untreated sediment contains only a small part of the total iron. Phosphate in the treated cores correlates with iron in the HCl pool, and seems to accumulate in the Fe rich layer. Assuming the iron species in the HCl pool effectively bind all dissolved phosphate until it is saturated, the binding capacity of the Fe in this pool can be calculated by the phosphate-to-iron ratio (P/Fe) in the HCl pool of the untreated sediment, where Fe is saturated with phosphate and P is thus found dissolved in the porewater.  In the HCl pool of the non-treated cores P/Fe ratio is about ~0.3 meaning every 3 mole of Fe binds 1 mole phosphate. The P/Fe ratio in the HCl pool of the treated sediment is about 0.05, which means that there is still capacity for binding 0.25 mole of phosphate per mole of iron in the HCl pool before it is saturated. However, that is under the assumption the Fe speciation in the HCl of treated and non-treated cores is the same, which is not necessarily the case. Thus rises the question is in what way the phosphate is bound to iron in the HCl pool. Regarding the Fe speciation and its association with P there are several possibile mechanisms:

* Phosphate can be adsorbed to amorphous Fe oxides.

* Fe and P are in complex with organic matter (P-Fe-OM).

* Phosphate and Fe$^{2+}$ can coprecipitate and form mineral phases, primarily vivianite (Fe$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$).

* Phosphate is not associated with Fe at all, but is bound to another phase extracted with HCl (carbonates). 

Whilst the redox potential in the sediment is in the range of sulfate reduction, and thus well below the zone where amorphous iron oxides are stable, the presence of Fe$^{3+}$ in the porewater suggests dissolution of an oxide phase. Furthermore, the large volume of iron in the HCl pool does signify much solid iron, which is difficult to explain with only solid Fe$^{2+}$ phases such as vivianite and FeS and Fe-OM complexiation, as Fe$^{2+}$ is much more soluble. It is therefore probable that the HCl pool contains unreacted iron oxides from the treatment sludge. The large surface area of poorly ordered Fe oxides accomodates high number of adsorbtion sites, so it is expected at least part of the phosphate in the HCl phase is adsorbed  to this phase. 
Nevertheless, reductive conditions in sediment would have continually accumulated Fe$^{2+}$ since the sludge was added, which most likely is found in the solid phase as well. Some of it precipitated with sulfide, but it is unknown how much and in what form it resides in the HCl pool. Significant precipitation of vivianite is has been shown to require high supersaturation, while here the saturation index of vivianite is just above 1 at neutral pH. [@rotheOccurrenceIdentificationEnvironmental2016] Still, lower in the sediment, where phosphate levels are higher and  Fe$^{3+}$ has less influence on oxic conditions, the precipitation of vivianite is more likely. [@emersonEarlyDiagenesisAnaerobic1976] Furthermore, vivianite could form directly from reducing oxides and phosphate. [@heinrichTransformationRedoxsensitiveRedoxstable2020; @jilbertIronManganeseShuttles2013] The formation of siderite (FeCO$_3$) cannot be excluded, since carbonate becomes available when it is released by mineralisation of organic matter, but often form at very high supersaturation. [@emersonEarlyDiagenesisAnaerobic1976]
Alternatively, both Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ can be complexed with organic substances. This could be the solid sediment matrix which contains a lot of organic matter, but also with more mobile humic substances. [@schwertmannNatureIronOxide1988]  These complexes seem to be less redox sensitive than mineral Fe$^{3+}$, and can keep iron bound in solid form. [@oconnellChangesSedimentaryPhosphorus2020]  It is uncertain what the redox transformation has for effect on associated phosphate in the complex, and there is a possibility that phosphate is released in this way without co-release of iron. 


Conclusive evidence that one specific form of P-Fe coupling controls phosphate dynamics in the HCl extractable Fe phases cannot be found within the data acquired in this study, and it is very likely the case that more than one phosphate binding mechanism is responsible for P fixation in the sediment. It is important to assess the relative contributions of these mechanisms and to identify the Fe-P species involved in order to evaluate the effectiveness of iron treatment in the long term, since every mechanism has specific dynamics of P release and Fe co-release. How permanent the different mechanisms bind phosphate in the sediment depends on the stability of the formed species under the expected conditions. P adsorbed to oxides is particularly vulnerable to the low redox conditions in the sediment, and will be mobilized over time, while P bound to reduced iron can form stable vivianite crystals which are removed permanently from the system as it is buried deeper in the sediment. [@oconnellVivianiteFormationIts2015; @rotheOccurrenceIdentificationEnvironmental2016] It is therefore an important next step to determine the oxidation state of iron in the sediment, in order to constrain the availability of Fe oxides and associated phosphate adsorbtion. However, for a more detailed investigation of Fe-P speciation in the treated sediment, the sequential extraction procedure used in this study is inadequate, as it is unable to distinguish individual Fe phases. Further research should focus on a comprehensive description of the Fe-P dynamics by analyzing the sediment composition in detail and quantifying the Fe phases.  Common analytic methods for determining mineral phases in sediment include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and spectroscopic techniques based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX, EMP). [@rotheEvidenceVivianiteFormation2014] In addition, phosphate speciation can be investigated with the use of phosphorous nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ($^{31}$P-NMR). 


## Influence of Fe addition on benthic fluxes

The problem of internal P loading is apparent when looking at the benthic fluxes of the untreated sediment. Without any external input, phosphate concentrations in the water reach highly eutrophic levels (~50 $\mu$mol/L, or 1500 $\mu$g/L). It is therefore important to evaluate in detail how the iron treatment changed the benthic fluxes. The low phosphate porewater concentrations as result of iron treatment persists throughout the iron-rich top 10 cm, and remain low at the sediment-water interface (SWI). Consequently, the diffusive flux of phosphate to the overlying water is very low, as demonstrated in the incubation experiment, where phosphate fluxes of the treated cores are an order of magnitude smaller than observed in the non-treated cores. Indeed, comparing porewater profiles of non-treated cores from before and after the incubation it appears that diffusion predominates the large increase in phospahate concentration observed during the experiment. Still, is is likely that other processes played a role as well. In particular OM mineralization, as studies show this is an important pathway for P release in organic rich systems. [@joshiOrganicMatterRemineralization2015] When assuming that OM mineralization close to the SWI controls the influx of nitrogen species, the associated P flux can be approximated with the Redfield ratio (16/1) for N/P stochiometry in OM. By using this ratio on the benthic flux measurements of ammonia and phosphate in the incubated cores, an estimated 20\%-30\% of the total P flux in the untreated sediment is governed by OM mineralization, assuming all released phosphate remains dissolved and is not re-adsorbed. In the treated sediment, on the other hand, several mechanisms described in the previous paragraph can bind phosphate released by OM mineralization before it can reach the water column. This explains why benthic P fluxes in the treated cores are very low when the water is rich in oxygen, even though nitrogen data show that organic matter is mineralized at similar rates as the other cores. Under anoxic conditions, however, phosphate is released to the water column from treated sediment as well, albeit much lower than in found the non-treated cores. This redox-sensitive P flux can be interpreted in two ways: 

1. Reduction of iron oxides in the shallow sediment releases P to the water column. [@kleebergRedoxSensitivityIron2013] 

2. P released independently of redox conditions, through organic matter mineralization or another process, is not fixed as efficiently in the sediment as it would when oxygen is present at the SWI.

To test these two hypotheses it is necessary to describe in more detail the processes taking place in the cores when the oxygen supply is removed. In the ferrous wheel principle, the redox change is only of importance very close (<1cm) to the SWI, as conditions deeper in the sediment would already be anoxic. Hence, a flux produced by reductive dissolution within this layer would not be diffusion-controlled, instead the flux will depend on the reaction rate. This leads to a high initial flux, which weakens when all material is reduced and the reaction stops. This pattern can be recognized in the benthic flux data of iron, where fluxes during anoxic incubation are in the range of several mmolm$^{-2}$day$^{-1}$ the first 10 days, after which the concentration stabilizes. This implies there is a reservoir of very active iron oxides residing in the top layer, presumably relatively recently precipitated when Fe$^{2+}$ diffused to the SWI and oxidized. However, the same pattern is not seen in the P flux of the treated cores, which exhibit a more gradual increase after the initial iron flux. Based on the fact P and Fe fluxes are uncoupled it can be concluded that the oxide toplayer did not contain significant amounts of phosphate. However, as the iron oxides in the top layer contain many adsorbtion sites, it binds phosphate diffusing from deeper layers or released from other sources. Consequently, when all of the oxides are reduced, this protective function is removed as well, and phosphate can move to the water columnn.  In this study, the following P flux is not coupled with Fe release, which could mean it is all produced by OM mineralisation. An alternitive explaination is that it is released when Fe$^{3+}$ is reduced, but the Fe$^{2+}$ is not mobilized and forms instead complexes with organic matter. Interestingly, the non-treated cores also show some redox sensitivity with respect to P fluxes, despite the low Fe content. Because the untreated sediment has a much smaller Fe oxide layer on top, it is completely saturated with phosphate. Thus, it lacks adsorbtion capacity and does not prevent phosphate from entering the water column, and will release a significant amount of phosphate when dissolved. 


## Implications

Within the limits of this study, internal P load appears to decrease with iron treatment. Still, the question remains on what timescale the treatment remains effective. Much is dependent on the speciation of Fe and P, and further research is necessary to determine the speciation in more detail. Still, the evidence suggests Fe$^{3+}$  in general, and amorphous iron oxides in particular remain in the sediment. This means the microbes in the sediment have not yet reduced all potential iron, and Fe$^{3+}$ is still a viable electron acceptor. In addition, the remaining iron oxides have the capacity to adsorb phosphate and in this way lowering the benthic P flux. However, it is expected that over time the iron oxides reduce, and this would remove an important fixing mechanism for phosphate in the sediment. This is not a problem when the iron is recycled and sufficient iron oxides are formed at the SWI, creating an effective trap for the phosphate. [@kleebergHowEffectivelyDoes2012] The supply of iron oxides in the oxic top layer is then driven by the amount of Fe$^{2+}$ diffusing to the surface. While the total reductive dissolution of iron oxides in the deeper sediment would create a very high gradient of Fe$^{2+}$, it would not necessarily diffuse all to the surface, and a significant part will be immobilized in mineral form. [@kleebergHowEffectivelyDoes2012; @smoldersSulphatemediatedIronLimitation1993] In a scenario where iron oxides contain the majority of the fixed P, the dissolution over time would increase P availability below the oxic zone. However, Other studies have shown vivianite can form from reduction of iron oxides with P adsorped. [@fredricksonBiogenicIronMineralization1998, @heinrichTransformationRedoxsensitiveRedoxstable2020]  Another important factor for the availability of both iron and phosphate is organic matter. The dynamics of organic matter with P and Fe in the sediment are complex and not well understood, but cannot be disregarded in view of the high OM content in peat sediment.  OM can form complexes with P and Fe fixing them in the sediment, but in the same way mobilize iron from minerals when the OM is dissolved itself. More importantly, it does not fix Fe or P indefinitely, which can be released when the organic matter degrades. Furthermore, there is cautious evidence that OM-Fe$^{3+}$ binds phosphate better than OM-Fe$^{2+}$, and in this way OM could be a sink for available Fe to bind P. In summary, the treatment remains effective when the pool of iron recycled to SWI is not saturated with phosphate, i.e. the recycled iron pool is more than 3 times as large as the phosphate pool. Unfortunately there are more ways to immobilize iron than phosphate and over time the treatment will become less effective. [@kleebergHowEffectivelyDoes2012] Moreover, when influx of phosphate in the sediment exceeds the removal by vivianite formation and burial, phosphate will accumulate in the active iron layer, forming an even larger reservoir to be released.

The P flux, though suppressed with iron treatment, is still significant under anoxic conditions. Wat would this mean for the system when stratification occurs, as can happen during summer months even in shallow peat systems? [@boersPhosphorusReleasePeaty1988] @kleebergRedoxSensitivityIron2013 poses that P release under anoxic conditions does not contribute to permanent P loading when release of Fe$^{2+}$ is sufficiently high, as it would adsorb to preciptated iron oxides as it approaches the oxycline. The iron concentration in our study does exceed the phosphate in the surface water several times, and would be sufficient to reprecipitate. On the other hand, the iron flux during the anoxic incubation stops after the initial increase when the layer of iron oxides is dissolved, while the phosphate concentration steadily increases. In the event of a higher degree of saturation, and a stronger phopsphate flux from within the sediment, it can happen the phosphate concentration is too high for the iron to reprecipitate, resulting in internal P load. [@kleebergHowEffectivelyDoes2012] In addition, the iron could bind to OM after reduction, while P is released. 

While the focus of this research is on the dynamics of Fe and P, a brief discussion on other geochemical effects of Fe treatment is appropriate, since the nutrient cycles of N and S also play an important role in aquatic ecosystems. The supply of sulfuric compounds is generally very high, exemplified by surface water sulfate concentrations in the mM range. The ensuing importance of microbial sulfate reduction the sediment not only assures a steady release of organic bound nutrients including P, it also increases sulfide levels in the porewater, which drives diffusion of sulfide to the oxic water column where it is recycled as sulfate, closing the cycle. Theoretically, the addition of large quantities of iron will disrupt the S cycle when an excess of dissolved Fe$^{2+}$ precipitates the sulfide and inhibits recycling. Over time, if sulfate reduction is maintained in the iron rich sediment, sulfur and iron will accumulate until eventually one of the reactants is depleted. [@smoldersSulphatemediatedIronLimitation1993] Indeed, from the sulfur cycle perspective iron acts as a sink for sulfide. How the disruption of sulfur cycling influences the local microbiome or the larger ecosystem should be investigated further, as for instance the decrease in toxic sulfide concentrations could have a beneficial effect on organisms.  
However, this theory would involve increased pyrite formation after iron addition, which has not been observed in this study. Instead, a decreased total sulfur combined with a smaller HNO$_3$ extracted pyrite pool in treated sediment suggests the opposite: that less sulfide is stored in the solid phase compared to the untreated sediment. To explain this discrepancy it is necessary to consider that Fe$^{3+}$ reduction has a higher reduction potential than sulfate reduction. Studies on marine sediments have shown Fe$^{3+}$ is able to oxidize sulfide at deeper levels, albeit not completely to sulfate, but to intermediate sulfoxanions such as sulfite (SO$_3^{2-}$) and thiosulfate (S$_2$O$_3^{2-}$). [@holmkvistHolmkvistFerdelmanTG2011] It is possible that this type of sulfide oxidation takes place in the treated sediments and exceeds sulfate reduction, leading to the observed decrease in solid bound sulfide. The sulfur mobilized as intermediate oxianions can be recycled in place of sulfide, and many sulfate reducing microbe can metabolise these compounds. [@kramerSulfateFormationATP1989] The cycling will then stop when all iron in the anoxic zone has been reduced, and Fe disrupts the S cycle as theorized before. In a next study, the hypothesis of iron mediated sulfur cycling can be easily tested by measuring sulfite and thiosulfate concentrations in the porewater. 

From The difference in reduction potential of Fe$^{3+}$ and sulfate follows that the former is energetically more favorable for metabolism than the latter, so iron-reducing microbes have an advantage over their sulfate-reducing counterparts. The  addition of iron oxide as metabolic pathway could therefore curb sulfate reduction. [@holmkvistHolmkvistFerdelmanTG2011] That this is not happening in this study, as can be seen in similar sulfate reduction rates in both treated as non-treated cores, is possible because organic matter is available in such abundance, that there is no competition for energy sources. Indeed, the evidence suggests iron reduction becomes a metabolic pathway in addition to, not instead of, sulfate reduction, resulting in increased rates of organic matter mineralization after iron treatment. Because OM mineralisation directly influences the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, the presumed increase of mineralisation rates should be monitored on a longer timescale to determine if the increase persists, or if the rates are temporarily increased after addition, when Fe oxides are still available deeper in the sediment.
