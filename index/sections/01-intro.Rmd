# Introduction

Since the the invention of agriculture, humanity has had influence on Earths natural cycles, and this increased dramatically after the start of the industrial revolution.  One of these profound impacts, and most damaging for freshwater ecosystems has been a large increase in available phosphorous (P) dissolved the surface water. P, on earth predominantly found in oxidized form as phosphate (PO$_4^{3-}$), is crucial for many biochemical processes, and typically a limiting nutrient for plant growth as natural release from minerals is a relatively slow process. [@schindlerFoodWebStructure1993] For this reason, P availability has been an constraint for food production during most of human history, when agriculture could only be sustained on fertile soil where P was replenished, such as floodplains, and P-rich manure was a valuable commodity. [@ashleyBriefHistoryPhosphorus2011] From the 19th century onwards people have turned to mineral sources of P in an effort to feed the growing human population. At first, guano (accumulated bird droppings), became the primary source material for fertilizers, but as guano reserves became increasingly scarce, the large scale mining of rocks rich in P took over. In combination with artificially fixated nitrogen, mined P forms the bulk of all fertilizers used today, and without a continued P supply we would not be able to produce enough food to sustain the current population. [@cordell2010; @vaccariDemandDrivenModelGlobal2019] However, the intensive use of mineral P has disrupted the natural P cycle, and replaced it with a linear lifecycle, where a finite supply of P rock provides the P for plant growth, while the P containing products are shipped globally and accumulates elsewhere, ultimately ending up in oceans lakes and soils.[@ashleyBriefHistoryPhosphorus2011] This linear P pathway is not only threatening food security in the future when mineral P reserves will ultimately deplete, today already we encounter severe problems caused by P accumulation. [@ansariEutrophicationCausesConsequences2011; @mekonnenGlobalAnthropogenicPhosphorus2018] 


It is therefore imperative to recycle as much from the added P as possible, so less mineral P is needed. [@vaccariDemandDrivenModelGlobal2019] From sewage, where P is concentrated from food consumption and other P containing products such as detergents,  P can be recovered during sewage treatment. [@azamPhosphorousEnvironmentCharacteristics2019; @dorofeevRolePhosphateaccumulatingBacteria2020a; @wangPhosphorusCompetitionBioinduced2018] Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the P ends up in sewage and can be recovered, as most of the P leaks away after addition. Part of it is flushed out of the artificially fertilized soil by rain or irrigation, where it is discharged in surrounding surface water. [@sinhaEutrophicationWillIncrease2017] Additionally, if crops are used to feed livestock, P is accumulated in the manure and can cause extreme concentration of P if not recycled. [@ansariEutrophicationCausesConsequences2011] This is why P pollution often also a problem in places where no artificial fertilizer is used, when food is imported to feed animals and the manure is not exported. 

## The problem with P: eutrophication


The increased concentration of P in fresh surface waters disrupt the nutrient balance on which the ecosystem has relied before, where P is a limiting nutrient. [@schindlerFoodWebStructure1993] Not constrained by P scarcity, autotrophic microorganisms can multiply exponentially in number. The enrichment of water bodies with high amounts of nutrients and following phytoplankton bloom is called eutrophication. [@ansariEutrophicationCausesConsequences2011]  The algae or cyanobecteria blooms block incoming radiation, hindering plant growth.  The loss of aquatic plants, combined with an increase in decaying organic matter (OM) from dead plants and detritus, create very low redox conditions above the sediment, resulting in anoxia.  [@correllRolePhosphorusEutrophication1998] The lack of oxygen leads to loss of aerobic respirators, including aquatic animals, and this further increases the stockpile of dead OM,  enhancing the reductive conditions. [@matthewsLongTermChanges2006] In addition to suppressed oxygen availability,  eutrophication causes ecological damage when the anoxic conditions allow harmful substances to release from the sediment, notably sulfide (HS$^-$) and ammonium (NH$_4^+$), both toxic for aquatic life in high concentrations. Meanwhile, P levels remain high through reduction of metal oxides adsorbing P, together with P release from organic matter mineralization. 

## External and internal loading

Eutrophication rarely develops in natural systems, only where the small natural P fluxes can accumulate over time, and develops on geological timescales. [@ansariEutrophicationCausesConsequences2014] It is therefore primarily a phenomenon caused by human activities, and is more widespread than it would be under natural circumstances.

The increase in P concentaration starts when P rich water enters the lake or river. This external source of P is commonly referred to as external P loading.  Raw sewage and wastewater have polluted waters near urban centers since before industrialization and the issue persists today in many parts of the world. [@ashleyBriefHistoryPhosphorus2011; @azamPhosphorousEnvironmentCharacteristics2019] Due to improvements in wastewater treatment, the external P load in Europe was reduced and P levels in European rivers and lakes have on avarage decreased since 1992. [@NutrientsFreshwaterEurope] However, the average P concentration has stabilized in recent years at still dangerously high levels, as P load from agricultural runoff has become a major pollutant, and causes widespread eutrophication many areas. [@ansariEutrophicationCausesConsequences2011; @mekonnenGlobalAnthropogenicPhosphorus2018] The large global increase in demand for animal products such as meat and dairy provoked an upscale and intensification of livestock farming, leading to vast numbers of production animals kept close together. Via imported animal feed, the nutrients from large sections of farmland are thus concentrated within a small area, and often leak to the local surface water. It is for this reason that almost all freshwater systems in areas with large-scale intensive livestock farming, such as the Netherlands, experience some degree of eutrophication.

 From research on lake restoration during the 20th century it became clear that eutrophication persists even if all external sources are removed, as the source of P lies within the lake sediment itself, hence: internal P loading.[@wagner2020, @schindlerRecentAdvancesUnderstanding2006] The recycling of P is a natural process OM containing P settles on the lake sediment, and P is released when OM mineralizes in the sediment (Fig. \@ref(fig:intern)). The P cycling is thus closely linked to the cycling of OM in lakes, which depends on primary production. In eutrophic systems, primary production is high, thus OM and P are deposited at an increased rate. When a freshwater system has experienced eutrophication from external sources over a long period of time, much of the P is sequestered in the sediment by OM deposition. [@oconnellChangesSedimentaryPhosphorus2020] After the removal of an external source, decomposing OM releases P to the water column, and this recycling of P can keep the water eutrophic for decades after external loading has been removed. [@chorusDecadesNeededEcosystem2020; @sondergaardRetentionInternalLoading2001] 

## Lake restoration targeting internal P loading

The extent of the ecological damage from eutrophication prompted efforts to restore water quality of lakes and rivers in some places. However, eliminating external loading, by insulating the system from nutrient rich water sources in the vicinity  and allowing only small-scale agriculture nearby, is often not sufficient, particularly if the system has been severely eutrophic for a long time. For healthy P levels, the internal P loading has to be lowered as well. Physical removing the sediment by dredging will remove some of the P rich layer, but is an expensive method and is not always effective as it is restricted in how much sediment can be removed, and high P concentrations often persist deep in the sediment. [@zamparasRestorationEutrophicFreshwater2014] Moreover, it is an invasive technique which disturbs the sediment and risks contaminating the water. The problem of internal loading stems from the high dissolved fraction of P in the sediment, so a promising solution is to bind the P in the sediment so release is stopped. [@azamPhosphorousEnvironmentCharacteristics2019] Several materials are used as a P-sorption agent in  other applications and could be used to mitigate internal P loading, including modified zeolites, lanthanum enhanced clays and aluminum compounds. [@azamPhosphorousEnvironmentCharacteristics2019] While some of the materials have a high adsorption capacity for P, a lot has to be added to effectively bind the large reservoir of P in the sediment, which can be an expensive endeavor. Moreover, the solids could be buried deeper while phosphate rich sediment remains close to the surface, making this method less effective. Iron (Fe) compounds are particularly of interest for P binding in sediment. While less absorptive compared to materials designed to bind P such as lanthanum clays, Fe is abundantly available and can easily applied in large quantities.

## Issues of using Fe to bind P

 In contrast to most sorbents used to bind P, Fe is relatively reactive, and sensitive to redox conditions. While this is problematic for some applications, the redox sensitivity of iron can be an advantage for containing P in the sediment. Fe is found in many natural systems, and the redox-driven cycling in lake sediments is well documented. [@emersonEarlyDiagenesisAnaerobic1976]  Solid phase ferric iron (Fe$^{3+}$) in sediments with low redox conditions can be used by chemotrophs as electron acceptor and reduced to ferrous iron (Fe$^{2+}$) which is generally more soluble. The now mobile Fe$^{2+}$ can diffuse back to the surface, where it is oxidized again and precipitates in the form of iron oxides. The reductive dissolution of Fe was previously thought to lower its effectiveness as sorbent, as less adsorption sites remain available. However, through this process Fe is continue recycled  and remains close to the surface where it can adsorb P released in the sediment. [@kleebergHowEffectivelyDoes2012]  This so called "ferrous wheel" forms in this way an quasi-permanent layer of iron oxides on top, which is an effective trap for P in the sediment. This mechanism can remain in effect until the Fe pool is saturated with P (Fig. \@ref(fig:fwheel)). Ideally, the P is bound deeper in the sediment as well to Fe$^{2+}$ to form vivianite (Fe$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$)), removing the P from the system entirely.

In this figure possibility of forming vivianite (Fe$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$) is also presented. Fe is removed from the ferrous wheel when it reacts with dissolved sulfide, and precipitates.

## Fe containing by-products

Fe can be added to the system in several forms: as salt, or directly as solid oxide. At Bovenlanden, the research site of this study, Fe-containing by-products from water treatment was used to treat several ditches with the goal of reducing internal P loading. Water from subsurface aquifers contains substantial concentrations of Fe, and to make the water potable Fe is precipitated through aeration and filtered.  The precipitate which is the by-product consists primarily of ferric (oxyhydr)oxides. Many water treatment plants produce the by-product and it is therefore available in large volumes at low costs.


## Peat wetlands in the Netherlands and their restoration

As part of the Rhine delta, marine clay deposition and peat layers formed the Western part of the Netherlands during the Holocene. Originally  comprised of mainly inhabitable peat bogs and tidal marches, the area was drained and cultivated gradually during medieval times. A system of ditches, canals and lakes developed as a result of drainage practices, and the intensive extraction of peat as energy source. [@borgerDrainingDiggingDredging1992] In an effort to stimulate dairy production, intense farming of cattle was introduced in the area during the 20th century. As a consequence, most surface water is highly increased in nutrients, and eutrophication is widespread.  In recent years the negative effects of land reclamation and intensive agriculture of peat marches has attracted more attention. Dry peat soils cause subsidence and emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Efforts to re-wet parts of the western peat area are combined with restoration goals for biodiversity, as many meadow birds characteristic for this kind of landscape can thrive on wet grassland. However, the plentiful lakes and ditches in the area remain polluted by nutrients. [@keizerPhosphorusSedimentLoosdrecht1992] Improvement of surface water quality is essential to restore the nutrient poor conditions of biodiverse types farmland common in this area before the industrial revolution.

## objectives

Treating freshwater systems with iron has been done before, and it has been shown that many parameters control the cycling of P and Fe. Several studies have shown that high sulfur (S) content can weaken the effectiveness of Fe treatment by binding the iron as sulfide. [@kleebergHowEffectivelyDoes2012, @smoldersSulphatemediatedIronLimitation1993] Other studies show that OM is important in the cycling of P and Fe. [@oconnellChangesSedimentaryPhosphorus2020; @schwertmannNatureIronOxide1988] As hydrological and geochemical conditions vary widely between systems, its effect on P and Fe dynamics is uncertain. The ditches in Bovenlanden were treated to mitigate internal P loading, but the resulting sediment composition nor the biogeochemical cycling of P and Fe has been investigated. In this study, we will do this by comparing the sediment of a treated ditch in Bovenlanden to sediment from untreated ditches in the same area.
 By analyzing samples from the field in detail and monitoring the nutrient dynamics under laboratory conditions, we aim to answer the following questions:

* Can the Fe from treatment be recognized in the sediment, and what is the Fe speciation?

* Did iron treatment bind P in the sediment, and in which binding form?

* How does iron treatment influence the internal P load in peat extraction ditches?
