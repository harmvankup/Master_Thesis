# Acknowledgements {-}

First and foremost I want to thank my supervisors Thilo Behrends and Melanie MÃ¼nch, for sharing their knowledge and practical help, and I especially enjoyed the fruitful discussions. I also want to thank all PhD and master students I have had the honor to meet during the practical work, for the lively conversations we had during breaks and outside of university.
